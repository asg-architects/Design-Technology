## Problem Statement
We need to understand the foundation and availability of open AI models and processes to understand what tasks can can augmented through minor AI intervention.   

## Thesis
Small nudges in AI workflows will yield great value at low cost.

## Summary
We are exploring a series of AI models and processes, largely through open-source models and github repositories with help through ChatGPT. 

## Projects
### Dot counter:
*Read dots within an image and report quanity, color, and label based on board layout*

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR, Handwriting Recognition)
*Read handwritten notes on post its add to client engagement boards*

### AI Integration into Revit
*Explore processes for using AI chatbot and document retrieval within the Revit environment*

### Document Semantic Search (Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG)
*Query data from a directory of documents*

### Natural Language Processing Query of Structured Project Data
*Query project data using NLP within the Project Lab Dashboard environment*
