## Problem Statement
AEC tech is ages behind, and so is our tech stack. It’s time to adopt new ways of working in AEC. The AEC industry is facing several problems that Speckle has set out to address:
-	Avoid or minimize proprietary lock-in and cost (see: [Open Letter To Autodesk](https://aecmag.s3.amazonaws.com/AEC_Autodesk_customer_letter.pdf))
-	Getting away from solitary file-based workflows that are not collaborative.
-	Find ways to more consistently and reliable deliver design
-	Find ways to work more collaboratively with people with a diversity of expertise and skills.
-	Find ways to better analysis, evaluate, and visualize our designs without long one-way workflows that cannot be easily repeated.
-	Find ways to better support more modern computational and parametric based design methods in our process and delivery.


## Thesis
If data can be stored in a platform agnostic and open-source format, then we can leverage and data more powerfully and seamlessly. Speckle is an open-source platform that aims to provide a collaborative data hub that connects with our AEC tools and can address some of our issues:


## Summary
Speckle is an open-source platform for collaboration in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. It allows teams to share, manage, and exchange 3D models and data across various software platforms, such as Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, AutoCAD, and more. Speckle facilitates interoperability, enabling seamless data transfers without the typical file format constraints that can hinder collaboration between different software tools.

Here are some of its key features:

1. Data Sharing: Speckle allows users to share parts of or entire models as data streams, which can be accessed and modified across different applications and stakeholders.
2. Version Control: It helps track changes and iterations in the design process, allowing multiple users to collaborate on the same project in real-time or asynchronously.
3. Interoperability: By using Speckle connectors, data can flow between different tools such as Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, Blender, and more, supporting cross-platform collaboration.
4. Customization and Extensibility: Since it’s open-source, Speckle can be customized or extended with plugins or specific tools for particular project needs.
5. Data-Rich Collaboration: Besides geometry, Speckle supports the transfer of metadata, which can be essential for integrating various aspects of the design process, from BIM data to parametric models.

It’s widely appreciated by interdisciplinary teams in the AEC sector for reducing the friction of working between different software environments and promoting more efficient collaboration.

## Demostration / Collaboration Day Showcase
This year, at Collaboration Day, we created a showcase of how Speckle could be used to improve, supplement, or replace our current workflows. The showcase demonstrated the use of speckle on a case-study project in Fort Wayne, IN. A project that was recently awarded to ASG to plan and design the first phase of a 7 acres redevelopment of a Former Pepsi Bottling plant.
