# Context Model Automation

## Problem Statement
The existing process and workflows for creating and rendering compelling ariel fly-throughs is expensive and time-consuming

## Thesis
A new workflow that utilizes real-time renderings engines, 3D map tile, and repeatable interoperability between the Design Tools and the Visualization Tools will improve the viability of quality of the aerial narrative we wish to craft.

## Summary

On the Design Side:

- Workflows for the importing of photometric Context Models eliminates the need for re-modeling context and increases the accruace when handing off to the Viz team.

On the Visualization Side:

- Unreal engine provides a powerful engine for compelling lighting, realiistic textures, and rich entorage while allowing for real-time immersion, and fast media exports.
- Cesium with GoogleMaps Tiles provides an accurate 3D context reconstructed from aerial and satalite photography, removing the tedious and time-consuming task of modeling existing context.

## Application
