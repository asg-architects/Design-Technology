# Intranet Upgrade

## Problem Statement
The current intranet has become an important cornerstone of how we share and location information within our firm.  Unfortunately, due to deprecation and delinquency, the current intranet had become cumbersome and inadequate for the average employee to find relevant information.

## Thesis
The impending update to Knowledge Architectures New Synthesis 6 platform gives us a tremendous opportunity to reevaluation how we use the intranet. The organization, the provided features, and the * should all be reconsidered to determine how we can best serve our community.
