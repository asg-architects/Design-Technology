# Parametric Facade Design

## Problem Statement
Facade designs can often be defines by a small set of rules and variables

## Thesis
Defining facade designs through a set of rules and parameters allows for easy modification and adaptation to changes in requirements or preference. Furthermore, parametric models can automate the modelling process that would otherwise be tedious, time-consuming, and unforgiving to change.

## Conclusion
Parametric Design is an itelligent way to be adaptable and ready for change. The up-front cost can be greater and the expertise required can be high. This can reduce the ROI and the accessibility for the average project. The pros and cons should be weighed for each project along with any future value beyond a specific project.

## Next Steps
- Evaluate alternative parametric design tools like:
    - Railclone(3dsMax)
    - GeometryNodes(Blender)
    - Flow (Giraffe)
    - Test-fit
    - Dynamo(Revit)
- Create a design spec for an idealized parametric design tool.
