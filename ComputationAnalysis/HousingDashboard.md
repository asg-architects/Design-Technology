- Revise data scheme to work more universally across project types (currently in JSON format, likely switching to hybrid of SQL for high-level project data and GeoJSON for inidividual building data)
- Re-format to simplify data viewing process
- Add data set comparison feature
- Add AI feature for natural language processing
