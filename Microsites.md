![Example Image](/assets/MicrositeExample.png)

## Problem Statement
There is not a simple, professional, easy-to-use, and easy-to-access, method for sharing, and managing project assets.

## Thesis
Create a web app that allows for the easy creation of custom, shareable mircosites that can host and present a variety of project assets and information.

## Summary
A prototype Node.js /React app was created that can host and present images, folders, video, models, text, and iFrames in an easy to customize grid layout. The prototype is hosted at *.asg-designs.com where the * can be any short identifier for a project or site. 

Features:
- Drag and drop file uploads.
- Folders allow for deeply nested hierarchies.
- 3D model viewer that supports loading in Augmented Reality for intuitive interaction.

## Conclusion
The site succeeds in providing a easy-to-create, easy-to-access site for sharing project assets. Further development would include:
- Move hosting and storage to asg AWS services and ayerssaintgross.com domain.
- Integrate with ASG data to connect to vantagepoint for project info and openasset for image storage and processing.
- Add security and authorization so we can control who can view, edit, and share these sites.
- Work with Graphics and Marketing to develop and improve the visual style and layout to fit with brand guides.
- Add features for linking, and presentation mode. Add support for more formats like PDFs and PPTs.
- Fix bugs.
