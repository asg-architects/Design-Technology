# Collaboration Day - Design Tech - Showcase

## Problem Statement
People don't know all the ways we could better use technology to collaborate and communicate.

## Thesis
Create a showcase to technology use cases that demonstrate a modern collaborative environment

## Stations

### Station 1
*Concept Design:* Rhino or SketchUp station for free-hand massing-modelling.
Output geometry is sent to Speckle.

### Station 2
*Computation Design:* Grasshopper station with a pre built script for demonstrating the flexibility of parametric design.
Output geometry is sent to Speckle through Grasshopper.

### Station 3
*Data Driven Design:* Revit/SketchUp Station with simple rooms defined and re-assignable. Output is through a speckle export of room data. A custom Power-BI dashboard receives the data.

### Station 4
*Sustainable Design:* Forma Station that uses the Revit or Rhino Extension to import geometry for analysis. This station has no export.

### Station 5
*Visualization:*
- Option 1: VR/AR station that can receive and composite all the speckle models together into a VR app.
- Option 2: A SketchUp Station that receives the speckle streams and then loads it in Enscape.
- Option 3: A public microsite that displays a speckle viewer

### Station 6
*Accessibility:* A public website that displays a speckle viewer, some rendered views, some analysis diagrams, a power-bi dashboard

### Station 7
*Communication:* 
- Option 1: Use Speckle comments.
- Option 2: Use a Project tracker KanBan.
- Option 3: Use the Zoom API to show zoom chat on 

### Station 8
*Presentation:*
- Option 1: Link all this stuff into a powerpoint
- Option 2: Link all this stuff into an InDesign
- Option 3: Link all this stuff into a Movie (Unreal Timeline)
